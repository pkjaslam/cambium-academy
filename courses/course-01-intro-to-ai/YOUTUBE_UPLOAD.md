## Re-rendering the video (any future edit)

The whole pipeline is saved in `script/render/` (narration.py, tts.py, seg.sh). Change the narration or voice there, re-run TTS and seg.sh, concat, done. Rendering is free (edge-tts neural voices + ffmpeg). To re-render with a different voice, edit the VOICE line in tts.py; samples of four candidate voices live in `script/voice-samples/`.
